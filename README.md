### Description
This assignment contains the base reverseDigits.h code and reverseRun.cpp to 
complete a small program that reverses a user's integer input. The 
reverseDigits.h code contains one method that reverses that integer. The 
reverseRun file contains the main method and a validator method that will 
continually ask the user for a correct integer input (recursively) and then run 
the method in reverseRun to process the actual reverse output on console.
